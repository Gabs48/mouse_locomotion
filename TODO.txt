Todo:

- More plausible muscle placement (~~done)
- Design a good controller without focusing too much on placement

- Increase sim rate (enabled from Blender 2.77 -http://download.blender.org/release/Blender2.77/- with bge.logic.setTimeScale(2) )
- Increase sim rate: multiple models inside one simulation / multiple simulation in different subprocesses / distribute over multiple computers using torch
- Ameliorate Hill muscle Model (from matlab code)
- Design optimization framework 
- Optimize muscle parameters and placement

- Add feedback in the model (See force and position  feedback here: https://developer.blender.org/T35460)

- Replace oscillator with neural net (Karsten)
