Todo:

- Control bone separately with random forces
- Generate signal from brain controller
- Write transfer functions to apply force in center of gravity
- Implement Hill muscle Model (find one on internet)
- Connect muscles to bones
- Design framework for muscle, anchors and oscillators parameters optimization (find how to speed up, how to run on cluster)
- Add feedback in the model (See force and position  feedback here: https://developer.blender.org/T35460)
- Replace oscillator with neural net (Karsten)
- Add feedback to oscillator
